Currently, I am  a Principal Researcher at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business. I am in the job market 2021

My main research interests are in the broad field of applied probability and service operations management. Currently, I am working in the Operations and Management group at Booth School of Business conducted research for applications inspired by service firms (e.g., ridesharing firms (such as Uber and Lyft), online markers, etc). In particular, I am working on the development and analysis of stochastic process models that are relevant for service operations management decisions. Furthermore, I am working on a data-based project related to a subscription model. Based on real data from a company and using artificial intelligence methods, we investigate the main factors that lead the customers to subscribe to the company and suggest optimal strategies.
This analysis requires tools from probability theory, statistics, artificial intelligence, optimization, queueing theory, decision analysis, and simulation.
