Currently I am  a Principal Researcher at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business. 

My main research interests are in the broad field of probability theory and operations research. Currently, I am working on matching problems that appear in service platforms, for example, ridesharing firms (such as Uber and Lyft), online markers, etc. I develop optimal matching policies using asymptotic techniques.

During my Ph.D studies, I worked on fluid and diffusion approximations of stochastic networks with multiple interactive layers that appear in many applications such as communication, computer, manufacturing, and electric vehicle charging systems.
%The physical constraints provided by real-world systems and the stochasticity of the various elements  %provide me with a challenge in the modeling and analysis of these networks. The development and analysis of such models require tools from queueing theory, probability theory, optimization, statistics, and electrical engineering.
