I am currently a Principal Researcher in the Operations Management area at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business. I received my PhD in Applied Mathematics from Eindhoven University of Technology. 

My main research interests are in the broad field of Applied Probability and Service Operations Management. I develop policies that promote efficient management of service firms. This could mean optimizing the charging of electric vehicles or optimizing the matching of customers and workers in online platforms. Solving such
problems requires tools from probability, statistics, queueing theory, optimization, and engineering.
